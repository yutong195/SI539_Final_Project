            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <p>I am Yutong (Tony) Ren, a first-year master's student majoring in 
                information science at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor. 
                I graduated from Duke Kunshan University (Duke and Duke Kunshan dual degree) 
                and majored in Data Science. Studying and living in an interdisciplinary environment, 
                I got a chance to explore other disciplines and found my true enthusiasm 
                in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and gaming. I love to realize the thoughts 
                in mind with computer and design approaches. I have research experience in AR/VR 
                and game development. My research interest lies in the design and 
                development of games, interactive systems, and applications with AR, VR, and AI to 
                enhance people's abilities and bring social care.</p>
